/*
1. If you want the gravity in this scene to simulate the gravity in our
lives, what code would you type in?
I would put world.gravity.y = 10; because our earth's gravity is pulling us
down about 10m/s.


2. Imagine a game where gravity pulls everything to the right. What code 
would you need to write to set that up?
I would need to write world.gravity.x = 10; because x = 10 would
pull everything to the right
